# > BlitzCLI âœ¨

**Inspiration:**

I'm getting older in my career, I use a lot of cool stuff, and can't remember all the commands I use but wanted to make it easy to setup my enviornments in a user friendly but bespoke way.

### What is this?:

- BlitzCLI is a bespoke and experimental command line interface to help run commands and automations I use a lot; therefore, it may not work on your machine. 
- It's build on NodeJS and published as a public package.
- The focus audience is on developer experience and utilities for superusers that may not have prior development experience.

### Why name it Blitz?
- It's intended to be fast and help "attack" problems quickly

### Current intended Support:
- Latest macOS only / some linux support with commands that overlap
- Windows with pure git bash (intended for MinGW) will be supported at a later date or with PRs
- Full linux support will not be maintained but feel free to PR supporting commands and tools
